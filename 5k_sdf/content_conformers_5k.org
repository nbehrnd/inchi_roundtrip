* objective

  Script ~inchi_sdf.py~ permits the direct round trip of .sdf to be assigned a
  primary InChI string by ~inchi-1~ which the reference executable shall use to
  generate an intermediary .sdf to assign a secondary InChI string.  Thus, the
  round trip suggested then relies only on InChI trust's reference executable.

* description

  DataWarrior generated a library of 5k drug-like random molecules
  (~Random_Molecules_5k.dwar~); for each entry, a single conformer was suggested
  (~conformers_5k.dwar~) which was exported as .sdf v3000 file
  (~conformers_5k.sdf~).  Out of 5k structures submitted, 1803 entries are
  reported with an invariant InChI string (36.1%), and 3231 entries with a
  different InChI string (64.6) after compared to the InChI string prior the
  round trip.
