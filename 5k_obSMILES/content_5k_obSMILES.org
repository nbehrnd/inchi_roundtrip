* objective

  Script ~smiles_obsdf.py~ generates initial .sdf from a list of SMILES which
  enter the round trip to assign a primary InChI string by ~inchi-1~.  InChI
  trust's reference executable generates an intermediary .sdf to assign a
  secondary InChI string to compare with the primary string.

* description

  DataWarrior generated a library of 5k drug-like random molecules
  (~Random_Molecules_5k.dwar~) exported as a list file
  (~Random_Molecules_5k.txt~).  The SMILES of interest were extracted
  #+begin_src awk :tangle no
awk 'NR>=2{print $2}' Random_Molecules_5k.txt > Random_Molecules_5k.smi
  #+end_src
  for further processing.

  Out of 5k structures submitted, 2027 entries are reported with an invariant
  InChI string (40.5%), and 2973 entries with a different InChI string (59.5%)
  after compared to the InChI string prior the round trip.
