This project monitors round trip edits .sdf -> .inchi -> .sdf for molecular
data.  File ~inchi_roundtrip.org~ is the container to generate the scripts and
executables used (mainly Python, but including InChI trust's reference binary
for Linux/Mac, too).  The file equally documents the parameters of the check
runs performed and their results.

Data to process as well as initial results are organized in sub-folders; each
including a brief summary about the objective, listing of the corresponding
files, and a statement regarding the "rate of success" for the round trip edit
in question.
